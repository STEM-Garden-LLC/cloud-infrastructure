This will be a test work space initially as I research Terraform on behalf of Airtonomy. It may eventually become the real infrastructure as code repo for the STEM Garden LLC.

## Structure of this Repo

- Each folder in `/workspaces` corresponds to one Terraform Cloud Workspace in the organization [stem-garden-llc](https://app.terraform.io/app/stem-garden-llc/workspaces)

- Each folder in `/modules` corresponds to one STEM Garden custom infrastructure pattern that is reused in at least two workspaces.
